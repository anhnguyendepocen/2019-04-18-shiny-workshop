# Data Visualization with Maps Shiny Workshop

This repository will be updated with more information closer to the date of the event. *However, we ask that you install the following packages before the event*:

- `shiny`
- `leaflet`
- `spData`
- `dplyr`

You can do this with the following command in R:

```
install.packages(c("shiny", "leaflet", "spData", "dplyr"))
```

Optional: you can also register for a free account at [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) ahead of time.
