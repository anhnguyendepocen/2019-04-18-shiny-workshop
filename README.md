# Data Visualization with Maps Shiny Workshop

This repository will be updated with more information closer to the date of the event. *However, we ask that you install the following packages before the event*:

- **`sf`: to work with spatial data (this is a pain to install, if you are running into issues with installing the "units" package, please arrive early so we can get you set up)**
- `shiny`: to make a Shiny app
- `leaflet`: to make interactive maps
- `spData`: spatial data package that contains the data we'll be working with
- `dplyr`: for some data wrangling examples

You can do this with the following command in R:

```
install.packages(c("sf", "shiny", "leaflet", "spData", "dplyr"))
```

## If local installation isn't working...

If installation is not working for you on your local device, please create an account at [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) and install the packages in a new project there.

Optional: you can also register for a free account at [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io) ahead of time.
